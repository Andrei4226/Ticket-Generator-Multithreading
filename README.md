The project is written in C++ using the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment. It consists of a ticket generator for various activities such as cinema, theater, etc. The entire interface is designed from both the entrepreneur's and the client's perspectives.
The menu offers the possibility to read data from txt files or to communicate directly with the selected section.
In this application, I tried to implement some functions like <b>multithreading and mutex</b>.

It is an update for the first project in my github to name: <b>*Ticket-Generator-with-Menu*</b>

The project is built using classes in which I have implemented inheritances, pure virtual methods, operator overloading, members and static functions, indexing operators, pointer members, validations etc. 

To view the project, you can open the (.sln) file and click on the Run button.
